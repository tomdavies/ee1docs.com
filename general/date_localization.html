	<h1>Date Localization</h1>

	<p>ExpressionEngine stores all dates and times in UTC (Universal Coordinated Time), formerly known as  GMT (Greenwich Mean Time).  The benefit of doing so is that each member of your site can choose their own time zone and date localization settings.  This permits entries and other information containing dates/times to appear in each member's local time.  All dates are offset in real time for each user viewing your site.</p>

	<p>If people browsing your site are not members, or if they have not set a time zone preferences in their personal profile, 
	the times will instead be shown according to your master system localization settings found in the 
	<dfn><a href="../cp/admin/system_preferences/localization_settings.html">Admin &gt; Localization Settings</a></dfn> 
	area of your Control Panel.  If you prefer that the localization settings of a particular member be used as the site default
 	this can be specified in the <dfn>My Account > Administrative Options</dfn> page.</p>
	
	<p>If you do not wish to permit your members to set their own localization preferences you can disable the feature in the
	<dfn><a href="../cp/admin/members_and_groups/membership_preferences.html">Admin &gt; Membership Preferences</a></dfn>  page of the control panel.
	When disabled, the localization preferences page will not be accessible to members in their member profile area.
	

	<p><b>A note regarding Daylight Saving Time (DST).</b></p>

	<p>Since dates/times will adjust themselves automatically to your local time, an issue can arise if you view or edit weblog entries with dates 
	that fall outside your current Daylight Saving Time setting.  In order to compensate for this EE stores whether DST is active or not 
	on the date that an entry is posted.  You'll find this setting in the <kbd>PUBLISH</kbd> page under the <dfn>options</dfn> tab.  Although it will set itself 
	automatically when you post entries, if you find yourself editing the date of an entry, changing it so that it falls outside the
	dates that DST is active in your area, you may need to enable or disable this preference for that entry otherwise the time may be off by an hour.
