<p>Release Date: July 30, 2005</p>


<ul>
<li>Added forum support to the weblog module.  You can now submit forum posts directly from the PUBLISH page of the control panel, or you can link existing forum posts with weblog entries.  This enables you to have a "discuss this in our forums" link in your weblog entries.</li>
<li>Internally reconfigured how the member profile section is being triggered by the forum in order to reduce memory consumption.</li>
<li>Updated the preview page.  It now honors the display preferences for the parent forum, and it renders [quotes]</li>
<li>Updated the [quote] feature so that the date is not required, only the author.</li>
<li>Fixed a problem in which some forum template variables were being rendered in posts instead of shown literally.</li>
<li>Fixed a problem with the secure forms feature that affected searching when no results were found.</li>
<li>Fixed a breadcrumb error in the "new topic" form</li>
<li>Fixed an admin notification problem.</li>
<li>Fixed an error message that occurs when deleting the only post in a forum</li>
<li>Fixed an error message when posting due to a bug in the notification function.</li>
<li>Removed all "posting" buttons when a user is not logged in, even if a guest member group is given privileges, since non-logged-in users can not post.</li>
<li>Removed posting permissions checkboxes for guests, pending, and banned members in the forum control panel since they don't apply.</li>
</ul>
