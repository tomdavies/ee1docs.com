  <h2><a name="ee_paid_support"></a>ExpressionEngine (paid licenses) Technical Support</h2>
	 
	<p>Support for paid versions of ExpressionEngine is handled exclusively through our <a href="http://expressionengine.com/forums/viewcategory/4/">Technical Support Forums</a>. Our dedicated Technical Support Specialists and our development team monitor these forums and will help resolve any posted issues as quickly as possible.   Please read the <a href="http://expressionengine.com/docs/overview/getting_help.html">Getting Help</a> section of the User Guide before posting a support request.</p> 

	<p><em>Please note that you need to be logged in with the same account that was used to purchase ExpressionEngine in order to post.</em></p> 

	<p>If you are a developer working on a client's site and need tech support access do the following to get access to the Technical Support Forums:</p> 

	<ol> 
	<li>Register for an ExpressionEngine.com account.</li> 
	<li><span id='eeEncEmail_rJTgQ2mfxK'></span><script type="text/javascript">

	<li>We will update your account so you can access The Technical Support Forums. You will receive a confirmation email when your account has been updated.</li> 
	</ol> 

	<p><strong>Please do not email or private message the staff directly. The best way to get your issue addressed is to follow the guidelines above so the whole team has a chance to review the issue.</strong></p> 

<h2><a name="ee_core_support"></a>ExpressionEngine Core Community Support</h2>

	<p>If you are using ExpressionEngine Core you can get community based support in the <a href="http://expressionengine.com/forums/viewcategory/31/">Core Forums</a>.  Please remember that help you receive here is from friendly people who also use ExpressionEngine Core and not official EllisLab support staff.  If you love ExpressionEngine Core, please help others in the Core Community forums.</p>

<h3><a name="ee_bug_reports"></a>ExpressionEngine (all versions) Bug Reports</h3> 
 
<p>If you have a bug to report please use the <a href="http://expressionengine.com/forums/viewforum/10/">EE Bug Forum</a>. Make sure to review the <a href="http://expressionengine.com/forums/viewannounce/42453_10/">Reporting a Bug</a> post before submitting a bug report.</p> 
 
<h3><a name="eh_support"></a>EngineHosting Support</h3> 
 
<p>If you are a <a href="http://enginehosting.com/">EngineHosting</a> client in need of support, please visit the  <a href="http://www.enginehosting.com/web_hosting/support/">EngineHosting Support Page</a></p> 
 
<h3><a name="login_details"></a>Login Details</h3> 
 
<p>During the support process an ExpressionEngine Technical Support Specialist may ask for access to your FTP, MySQL, and/or ExpressionEngine installation. The TSS will always ask you to submit this sensitive information via a secured web form that has the same protections as the EE Store. They will send the URL to this form to you via email or PM.</p> 
 
<h3><a name="helping_others"></a>Community Involvement, Helping Others</h3> 
 
<p>Community members are encouraged to help one another.  Many enjoy doing so, switching roles from being a new user asking questions, to becoming an EE expert and answering them.  This has long been a hallmark of the ExpressionEngine community, and we welcome you to join in these ranks!</p> 
 
<p>In order to best assist new users and those having serious technical issues, the moderators may from time to time hide a community member's reply to a support thread that they deem as being off-topic or having the potential to confuse the user or hinder the troubleshooting process.
If this happens to you, please do not take offense; your reply in these instances has only been collapsed and not deleted, so if the user or others are interested, they may still read your reply.</p> 
 
<p>Though we want people to help each other, <em>never ask for someone's login information</em>. This is considered "bad manners." Posts asking for login information will be edited, deleted, or submarined without notice, and repeated occurrences may result in being banned.</p>

<h3><a name="3rdparty_support"></a>3rd Party Support on the Forums</h3> 
 
<p>There are a number of 3rd party developers who support their ExpressionEngine Add-ons directly in the EE Community Forums. If you are such a developer, do not publicly request someone's login. If you need a person's login details contact them privately through Private Message or email.</p> 
 
<p>If you are a user of a 3rd party EE Add-on be very careful when giving out sensitive information such as login details. It is your responsibility to verify the identity of the person requesting such information and you assume all risk associated with giving that information to a 3rd party. EllisLab is not responsible for what 3rd parties do with your information.</p>
