<h2>Running PHP as CGI</h2>


<p>People using servers that run PHP as a CGI process tend to encounter more difficulties than those with servers running PHP as a web server module.  Here are some additional things you can try.</p>



<p class="important">Typically, these tips will <strong>not</strong> apply to people on servers running PHP as a web server module.  Usually, they only apply to people on servers running PHP as a CGI process and even then not every user will need to do any of these.</p>


<h2>Add "shebangs"</h2>

<p class="important">This tip will only apply to <strong>some</strong> people on web servers running PHP as a CGI process.  Please consult your Host or server admin to determine if you will need to perform this.</p>

<p>On some servers, you will need to add a "shebang" line to two files in order to have ExpressionEngine work.  <strong>The actual syntax of the line can vary from server to server</strong>, so be sure to consult your Host or server admin for the correct syntax.</p>



<p>In the following two files:</p>



<ol>

<li><var>index.php</var></li>

<li><var>system/index.php</var></li>

</ol>

<p>You will need to add the following "shebang" line immediately before the opening PHP code.  The top of your files will look similar to:</p>



<code>#!/usr/bin/php<br />
&lt;?php</code>



<h2>File Permissions</h2>



<p>Some "PHP as CGI" servers automatically set uploaded files so that they do not have permission to "execute", which can cause problems with ExpressionEngine.  Make sure that all of your <var>.php</var> files are set to 755 (except those that are specifically mentioned as having other permissions in the instructions above).</p>



<h2>HTTP Headers</h2>



<p>Some "PHP as CGI" servers also do not like it if ExpressionEngine explicitly sends its own HTTP Headers.  Try going into <dfn><a href="cp/admin/system_preferences/general_configuration.html">General Configuration</a></dfn> and turn the "Generate HTTP Page Headers?" setting to "No".</p>



<p>If you cannot log into the Control Panel, then you will need to manually change the setting inside your <var>system/config.php</var> file:</p>



<code>$conf['send_headers'] = "n";</code>
