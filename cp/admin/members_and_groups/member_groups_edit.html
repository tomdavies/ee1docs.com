	<h1>Member Groups - Create/Edit</h1>
	<div class="path">Control Panel Location:&nbsp; <dfn>Admin &gt; Members and Groups &gt; Member Groups &gt; Create/Edit</dfn></div>	

	<p>This page describes each of the preferences available to your Member Groups.</p>

	<h2>Enable Group Security Lock</h2>
	<p>When a group is locked, only a Super Admin can assign a member to that group. If you allow other users to administrate member accounts, it is highly recommended that you ONLY unlock groups you want them to be able to assign other users to. Without this feature, anyone with administrative privileges could effectively assign themselves or others to member groups with greater privileges.</p>

	<h2>Site Access</h2>

	<h3>Can View Site When it is Online</h3>
	<p>Determines whether a member of this group can view your site when it is "online" in your <a href="../system_preferences/general_configuration.html">General Configuration</a> page. It is highly unlikely that you'll ever set this preference to "no" unless the Member Groups is used with banned users.</p>
	
	<h3>Can View Site When it is Offline</h3>
	<p>Determines whether a member of this group can view your site when it has been taken offline in your <a href="../system_preferences/general_configuration.html">General Configuration</a> page.</p>
		
	
	
	<h2>Member Account Privileges</h2>

	<h3>Can view public profiles</h3>
	<p>Determines whether a member of the group can view the public profiles of other members.</p>

	<h3>Can email other members via the profile email console</h3>
	<p>Determines whether a member of the group can email other members using the <dfn>Email Console</dfn> in the member profile area.</p>
	
	<h3>Include Members in PUBLISH page multi-author list?</h3>
	
	<p>Determines whether members of this group will appear in the <dfn>Publish</dfn> page "Multi-Author list".</p>
	
	<p class="important"><strong>NOTE:</strong> This setting overrides any individual users's setting in the <dfn>My Account</dfn> area.  If set here to "Yes", then <strong>all</strong> members of the member group will be displayed in the Multi-Author list drop-down in the <dfn>Publish</dfn> page.</p>
	
	<h3>Include Members in Site's Member List?</h3>
	<p>Determines whether members of the group are included in <dfn>Member List</dfn>, typically located at:</p>

	<h3>Can delete own account - deletes all posts, entries, and comments as well</h3>
	<p>Determines whether a member of the group can delete their own account.  If enabled, members of this group will be able to delete their own account through their front-end member control panel.</p>
	<p class="important"><strong>NOTE:</strong> When a user deletes their own account, it also removes <em>all content</em> created by them from your site: comments, weblog entries, forum topics, and forum posts.</p>
	
	<h3>Email Address of Delete Notification Recipient(s)</h3>
	<p>If the previous setting is set to "Yes", then these are the recipients of the email alert.  You may define a single email address or list multiple addresses by separating them with a comma.  Ex: "<samp>admin@example.com, joe@example.com</samp>"&nbsp; This notification only applies to members who delete their own accounts from their front-end member control panel, and not to members who are deleted from the system control panel by an administrator.</p>

	<h3>Can submit comments</h3>
	<p>Determines whether a member of the group can post comments.</p>

	<h3>Can use search utility</h3>
	<p>Determines whether a member of the group is allowed to use the simple or advanced search forms.</p>
