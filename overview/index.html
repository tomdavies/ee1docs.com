<h1>ExpressionEngine Overview</h1>

<p>This section will introduce you to ExpressionEngine and give you an overview of its features and capability.</p>


<h2>How People Use ExpressionEngine</h2>

<p>Thousands of web sites are powered using ExpressionEngine, from business sites, to online magazines, to personal weblogs. ExpressionEngine's flexible architecture allows an endless range of possibilities.  Please visit  <a href="http://expressionengine.com/showcase/">the Showcase</a> to see real world example sites and interviews with ExpressionEngine users.  Then visit the <a href="http://expressionengine.com/forums/viewforum/3/">Site Introductions</a> forum to see who has launched an ExpressionEngine site recently.</p>


<h2>The Big Picture</h2>

<p>Once you have installed ExpressionEngine, nearly all of your interaction with it will take place using the <a href="control_panel.html"><strong>Control Panel</strong></a>, which you will access using your <dfn>web browser</dfn>.  The Control Panel enables you to add content to your site, manage its design, send email, set preferences, and much more.</p>

<p>When you add content to your site using ExpressionEngine's control panel, it will be stored in a <dfn>database</dfn>.  When someone visits your web site, your content is retrieved from the database, formatted visually based on your <dfn>template</dfn> designs, and presented to them. ExpressionEngine is known as a <dfn>dynamic system</dfn>  since it generates your web site in real time for each user visiting it.</p>

<p>The power of ExpressionEngine's <em>dynamic</em> approach is that it allows much more power and flexibility than what is possible with a traditional <em>static</em> web site.  Your content can be easily formatted, precisely controlled, and flexibly reused in ways that would be tedious and difficult (if not impossible) to achieve with a static site.</p>

<h2>Some Examples</h2>

<p>To better illustrate how ExpressionEngine works, let's say you publish an online magazine. Your magazine has a home page that lists summaries of the five most recent articles. Each article summary links to a page with the complete text of the article. Your site also has an archive page that lists all the articles you've ever published.</p>

<p>With a traditional <em>static</em> web site, adding a new article to your site is a tedious process, requiring you to manually edit at least three pages: You'll have to update your home page with the most recent article's summary, you'll have to update your archive page with a link to your new article, and you'll have to add a brand new page for the full version of the article. These new pages must then be uploaded to your web server.</p>

<p>In contrast, ExpressionEngine makes adding a new article to your online magazine a breeze. Simply access the <em>Publish</em> feature using your web browser and ExpressionEngine will automatically update your home page, update the archive page, and create a brand new page featuring the full text of your article. These updates happen instantly, the moment you click "submit".  Or you can tell ExpressionEngine to make the changes to your site at a specific date and time in the future.</p>

<p>Here's another example:  Let's say you must update the copyright information in the footer that resides on all 200 pages of your web site. With a static web site this is a time-consuming proposition; each of the 200 files must be opened, edited, saved, and uploaded to your server.  With ExpressionEngine, however, you could set up a "footer" template that enables you to store your copyright information in one place, making it a breeze to instantly update all 200 pages just by making a change in one place.</p>

<p>Or let's say you decide to create a new archive page displaying your articles sorted alphabetically by title instead of chronologically. With a static web site you are in for a long afternoon of work.  But with ExpressionEngine, creating a new archive will take a few minutes; you'll simply create a copy of your existing archive template, then update the <em>parameter</em> that controls the order that the items appear.</p>

<h2>In a Nutshell...</h2>

<p>ExpressionEngine simplifies the process of managing your site while giving you more creative possibilities since you won't have to maneuver around your site's infrastructure, editing and uploading files. You can simply add your content in the EE Control Panel and the system will automatically format it based on your template designs. And since ExpressionEngine is managed using your web browser, you can update your web site from anywhere you have access to the internet.</p>
