<a name="overview"></a>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>With the release of ExpressionEngine 1.4 comes the ability to rewrite and modify the inner 
workings of the program.  Within ExpressionEngine are what is known as 'hooks'; little snippets 
of code in over 100 strategic places that allow the calling of 
third-party scripts.  <dfn>Extensions</dfn> can do things like modify an entire Control Panel page, 
add/remove functionality, and modify the appearance of certain page elements.  
Extensions enable third party developers to modify aspects of ExpressionEngine without hacking the backend scripts.  
You can think of an Extension as a plugin.  But unlike a plugin, Extensions are not used within your templates, they instead
allow you to modify the core system itself.
</p>

<p>An Extension is an add-on script that is placed in the <kbd>/system/extensions/</kbd>
directory and then enabled via the <a href="../cp/admin/utilities/extension_manager.html">Extensions Manager</a>
in the Control Panel.  
Extensions can have their own settings and their own database tables, if necessary, 
but neither is required. If settings are available for an Extension, a language 
file is required, but unlike a module there is no control panel for Extensions.</p>



<a name="naming"></a>
<h2>Naming Convention</h2>
<p>Extensions have a similar naming convention to ExpressionEngine plugins so current
developers should get the hang of them quickly.  There is only a single file required
for an extension and inside this file should be a PHP class.  The name of the class is 
used in the file name of the extension so that the name of the file is the <em>lower-cased</em> class name
with the prefix 'ext.' and the standard PHP suffix of '.php'. So, if we have a 
class called 'Example_extension', then our file name for this 
extension would be 'ext.example_extension.php'.</p>


<a name="base"></a>
<h2>Inside the Extension</h2>
<p>Inside an extension file should be a class, which will be called by ExpressionEngine
whenever this particular extension is required.  The constructor for the class will
require one parameter that will receive settings for the extension and set a class variable.</p>

<pre>
class Example_extension
{
    var $settings        = array();
    
    // -------------------------------
    //   Constructor - Extensions use this for settings
    // -------------------------------
    
    function Example_extension($settings='')
    {
        $this->settings = $settings;
    }
    // END
}
// END CLASS
</pre>

<p>Besides the $settings class variable, there are five other required class variables
that your extension should have.  These variables output meta information about
your extension to the Extensions Manager so that it can describe your extension, 
provide documentation, and update settings (if any).</p>

<pre>
class Example_extension
{
    var $settings        = array();
    
    var $name            = 'Example Extension';
    var $version         = '1.0.0';
    var $description     = 'Our example extension';
    var $settings_exist  = 'n';
    var $docs_url        = '';//'http://expressionengine.com';
    
    // -------------------------------
    //   Constructor - Extensions use this for settings
    // -------------------------------
    
    function Example_extension($settings='')
    {
        $this->settings = $settings;
    }
    // END
}
// END CLASS
</pre>

<p>If your extension has a language file, then the $name and $description class
variables can be set in the constructor by calling the language file and variables 
using the <a href="./usage/language.html">Language ($LANG) class</a>.  
If your extension is likely to be used internationally and by non-English speakers this
is a recommended course of action.</p>

<a name="enable"></a>
<h2>Activating and Updating</h2>
<p>There are two required methods for your extensions class that control the 
activating and updating of your extension.  The most important is the function used to activate
the extension in ExpressionEngine.  To activate an extension, you are simply
inserting a query into the database with various pieces of information like 
the extension hook and the name of the method in your extension's class to call
for this hook.</p>

<pre>
// --------------------------------
//  Activate Extension
// --------------------------------

function activate_extension()
{
    global $DB;
    
    $DB->query($DB->insert_string('exp_extensions',
                                  array(
                                        'extension_id' => '',
                                        'class'        => "Example_extension",
                                        'method'       => "rewrite_admin_home",
                                        'hook'         => "admin_home_page_start",
                                        'settings'     => "",
                                        'priority'     => 10,
                                        'version'      => $this->version,
                                        'enabled'      => "y"
                                      )
                                 )
              );
}
// END
</pre>

<p>Here is a quick run down of what each of these fields in the database table mean:
<ul>
<li><strong>extension_id</strong> - primary id for row in table</li>
<li><strong>class</strong> - name of your extension's class</li>
<li><strong>method</strong> - method being called for this extension hook</li>
<li><strong>hook</strong> - name of the extension hook in the program</li>
<li><strong>settings</strong> - serialized array of settings, usually empty by default</li>
<li><strong>priority</strong> - an extension hook could have many extensions being called, so there needs to be priority. 1 => First, 10 => Last.</li>
<li><strong>version</strong> - version of extension when activated, used for updating</li>
<li><strong>enabled</strong> - is this extension activated</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>Updating an extension is extremely easy in ExpressionEngine.  The user will
simply upload the new version of the extension and ExpressionEngine will automatically
update the extension the next time it is called.  All that is required is an intelligent 
function called update_extension().  The program will automatically compare the version
of the extension information in the database against the version of the extension file, and
if the extension file is a newer version it calls this function.</p>

<pre>
// --------------------------------
//  Update Extension
// --------------------------------  

function update_extension($current='')
{
    global $DB;
    
    if ($current == '' OR $current == $this->version)
    {
        return FALSE;
    }
    
    if ($current < '1.0.1')
    {
        // Update to next version 1.0.1
    }
    
    if ($current < '1.0.2')
    {
        // Update to next version 1.0.2
    }
    
    $DB->query("UPDATE exp_extensions 
                SET version = '".$DB->escape_str($this->version)."' 
                WHERE class = 'Example_extension'");
}
// END
</pre>



<a name="disable"></a>
<h2>Disabling</h2>
<p>When an extension is enabled for the very <em>first</em> time, the activate_extension()
function is called and all of the extension calls are inserted into the database.  When
an extension is disabled though, these extension calls are not removed from the database.
Instead they are merely disabled, which allows settings to be preserved and not removed
so that they are still there if the extension is enabled again in the future.</p>

<p>This causes a problem for developers who, while developing an extension, will often 
enable an extension to test their code but before they have added all of their extension calls
to the activate_extension() function.  What we have done is allowed the creation
of a disable_extension() function in an extension's class.  If this function exists
in the class, it will be called whenever your extension is disabled.
This will allow you to clear out your extension's data and basically start fresh
every single time.</p>


<pre>
// --------------------------------
//  Disable Extension
// --------------------------------

function disable_extension()
{
    global $DB;
    
    $DB->query("DELETE FROM exp_extensions WHERE class = 'Example_extension'");
}
// END
</pre>



<a name="settings"></a>
<h2>Settings</h2>

<h3>Abstracted Settings Form and Processing</h3>
<p>If you want to give your extension the ability to have settings, then we have
written an abstracted layer to make it extremely easy.  First, you have to make
sure that you have your $settings_exist class variable set to 'y'.  Second, you need
a language file for your extension with the file name of the language file being the extension's
lower-cased class name with a prefix of 'lang.' and a suffix of '.php'. Make sure the language
file is put in the <kbd>/system/language/</kbd> directory too.  And finally, you need to 
have a method in your extension's class called settings().  This function will 
return an array in a certain form that will help the Extensions Manager automatically
create a form for your settings.</p>

<pre>
// --------------------------------
//  Settings
// --------------------------------  

function settings()
{
    $settings = array();
    
    $settings['butter']    = "Quite Tasty";
    $settings['buttery']   = array('r', array('yes' => "yes", 'no' => "no"), 'no');
    
    // Complex:
    // [variable_name] => array(type, values, default value)
    // variable_name => short name for setting and used as the key for language file variable
    // type:  t - textarea, r - radio buttons, s - select, ms - multiselect, f - function calls
    // values:  can be array (r, s, ms), string (t), function name (f)
    // default:  name of array member, string, nothing
    //
    // Simple:
    // [variable_name] => 'Butter'
    // Text input, with 'Butter' as the default.
    
    return $settings;
}
// END
</pre>

<p>The above example will create a settings form with a text input field with a variable name of 'butter' and 
a default value of "Not Tasty" and a radio button field with a variable name of 'buttery' with possible
values of "Yes" or "No" and a default of "No".</p>

<p>A note about the values array for the second field, the keys 
will be used as the value for that item  while the value will be the language text for that item.  If you want,
the value can be the name of a language variable from your extension's language file and the Extensions Manager
will automatically retrieve it for you.


<h3>Built In Settings Form and Processing</h3>

<p>Alternatively, if your settings require a special form that cannot created by the abstracted layer
above, then ExpressionEngine permits you to create your own settings form and processing functions
within your Extension. First, you need to will need have a method in your extension's class called settings_form().  
This function will create the form and output it to Control Panel. Treat this function as any other page created 
for ExpressionEngine's Control Panel, so create it using the <a href="./usage/display.html">Display</a> class
and its methods.</p>

<pre>function settings_form($current)
{
    global $DSP, $LANG, $IN;
    
    $DSP->crumbline = TRUE;
    
    $DSP->title  = $LANG->line('extension_settings');
    $DSP->crumb  = $DSP->anchor(BASE.AMP.'C=admin'.AMP.'area=utilities', $LANG->line('utilities')).
                               $DSP->crumb_item($DSP->anchor(BASE.AMP.'C=admin'.AMP.'M=utilities'.AMP.'P=extensions_manager', $LANG->line('extensions_manager')));
    $DSP->crumb .= $DSP->crumb_item($this->name);
    
    $DSP->right_crumb($LANG->line('disable_extension'), BASE.AMP.'C=admin'.AMP.'M=utilities'.AMP.'P=toggle_extension_confirm'.AMP.'which=disable'.AMP.'name='.$IN->GBL('name'));
    
    $DSP->body = $DSP->form_open(
                                array(
                                        'action' => 'C=admin'.AMP.'M=utilities'.AMP.'P=save_extension_settings',
                                        'name'   => 'settings_example',
                                        'id'     => 'settings_example'
                                    ),
                                array('name' => get_class($this))
                            );
    
    
    $DSP->body .=   $DSP->table('tableBorder', '0', '', '100%');
    $DSP->body .=   $DSP->tr();
    $DSP->body .=   $DSP->td('tableHeadingAlt', '', '2');
    $DSP->body .=   $this->name;
    $DSP->body .=   $DSP->td_c();
    $DSP->body .=   $DSP->tr_c();
    
    $DSP->body .=   $DSP->tr();
    $DSP->body .=   $DSP->td('tableCellOne', '45%');
    $DSP->body .=   $DSP->qdiv('defaultBold', $LANG->line('log_table'));
    $DSP->body .=   $DSP->td_c();
    
    $DSP->body .=   $DSP->td('tableCellOne');
    $DSP->body .=   $DSP->input_text('log_table', ( ! isset($current['log_table'])) ? '' : $current['log_table']);
    $DSP->body .=   $DSP->td_c();
    $DSP->body .=   $DSP->tr_c();
    
    $DSP->body .=   $DSP->table_c();
    $DSP->body .=   $DSP->qdiv('itemWrapperTop', $DSP->input_submit());
    $DSP->body .=   $DSP->form_c();
}</pre>

<p>Lastly, you will need to have a method in your extension's class called save_settings().  
This function will be called when your settings_form() method's form is submitted.  Use it to process the data
sent and put it into the <dfn>exp_extensions</dfn> database table.  Remember that the data
put into the database is a serialized array, so handle it appropriately.</p>




<a name="extension"></a>
<h2>Calling of the Extension</h2>
<p>The following is an example of an ExpressionEngine Extension Hook that is available for use:</p>

<pre>
// -------------------------------------------
// 'publish_form_start' hook.
//  - Allows complete rewrite of Publish page.
//
	$edata = $EXT->call_extension('publish_form_start', $which, $submission_error, $entry_id);
	if ($EXT->end_script === TRUE) return;
//
// -------------------------------------------
</pre>

<p>The first parameter of <dfn>$EXT->call_extension</dfn> is the name of the hook, which lets the Extension
class know what extensions to call.  The other three parameters are variables taken from the function that the
hook is embedded within.  They provide information and data for the extensions being called for this hook, which
allows those extensions to have information about the script that allow them to perform certain actions or manipulate
data.  When an extension is called, ExpressionEngine loads the extension file, instantiates the extension's class, and then calls 
the method specified for this extension hook as specified by the extension when it was activated (see above concerning activation).</p>

<p>When that method is called in the extension's class those other three parameters will be sent to the method automatically.
Here is what the method might look like:</p>

<pre>
function replace_entry_form($which, $submission_error, $entry_id)
{
    global $DSP, $DB, $IN, $EXT;
    
    $EXT->end_script = TRUE;

    $DSP->body = 'New Entry Form Here';
}
</pre>

<p>The three parameters from the extension hook are mapped straight to the three parameters of the method being called,
and so your extension can easily use those parameters and do what it needs to do.  The ExpressionEngine.com 
<a href="http://expressionengine.com/developers/extension_hooks/">Extension Hook
library</a> will have a record of all extension hooks and the parameters available to you, along with a suggestion or two
about what can be done with the extension hook.</p>



<a name="hook"></a>
<h2>Multiple Extensions, Same Hook</h2>

<p>When an extension hook is called, ExpressionEngine checks the database to see if there are any extensions
available for the hook.  If there are extensions, then it processes them in order based on their priority level 
with the lower the priority number the sooner the extension is called.  Because of priority, extensions might interfere
with each other, so we have provided two variables for helping with that.</p>

<h3>$EXT->last_call</h3>

<p>There will be rather popular hooks being used by multiple extensions and some hooks will expect you to return
data to the extension hook.  Because of that, there is a variable available from the Extensions class ($EXT) that 
will contain the returned data of any prior extensions for that hook.  Say, there is a hook for formatting text and 
an extension before yours is called.  That extension will be returning the text formatted in its own way, but then 
your extension is called with the original text details being sent.  In such an instance of data being returned
and possible prior extensions, there is a variable available to retrieve that already formatted text: <dfn>$EXT->last_call</dfn>.
This variable will return whatever the last extension returned to this hook.  If there was no prior extension, then
the value of this variable is FALSE.</p>

<h3>$EXT->end_script</h3>

<p>Many extension hooks exist for the express purpose of totally controlling a page or script in the Control Panel.  They
are meant for redesigning the appearance of a form or perhaps usurping a script for processing form data.  In those instances
you want your extension to be the last thing called for that extension hook so that nothing else is processed after that point.
The <dfn>$EXT->end_script</dfn> exists solely for that purpose. If you set this value to TRUE, then once your extension
is done being processed the execution of the hook is finished, as is the script that the extension hook is contained within.</p>
